The extensions [`tex_math_dollars`](#extension-tex_math_dollars),
[`tex_math_single_backslash`](#extension-tex_math_single_backslash), and
[`tex_math_double_backslash`](#extension-tex_math_double_backslash)
are described in the section about Pandoc's Markdown.

However, they can also be used with HTML input. This is handy for
reading web pages formatted using MathJax, for example.
