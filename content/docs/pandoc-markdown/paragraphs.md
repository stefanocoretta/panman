A paragraph is one or more lines of text followed by one or more blank lines.
Newlines are treated as spaces, so you can reflow your paragraphs as you like.
If you need a hard line break, put two or more spaces at the end of a line.

#### Extension: `escaped_line_breaks` ####

A backslash followed by a newline is also a hard line break.
Note:  in multiline and grid table cells, this is the only way
to create a hard line break, since trailing spaces in the cells
are ignored.
