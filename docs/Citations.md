# Citations

When the `--citeproc` option is used, pandoc can automatically generate
citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. Basic usage is

    pandoc --citeproc myinput.txt

To use this feature, you will need to have

- a document containing citations (see [Citation
  syntax](#citation-syntax));
- a source of bibliographic data: either an external bibliography file
  or a list of `references` in the document’s YAML metadata;
- optionally, a
  [CSL](https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html)
  citation style.

## Specifying bibliographic data

You can specify an external bibliography using the `bibliography`
metadata field in a YAML metadata section or the `--bibliography`
command line argument. If you want to use multiple bibliography files,
you can supply multiple `--bibliography` arguments or set `bibliography`
metadata field to YAML array. A bibliography may have any of these
formats:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">Format</th>
<th>File extension</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">BibLaTeX</td>
<td>.bib</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">BibTeX</td>
<td>.bibtex</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">CSL JSON</td>
<td>.json</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">CSL YAML</td>
<td>.yaml</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">RIS</td>
<td>.ris</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note that `.bib` can be used with both BibTeX and BibLaTeX files; use
the extension `.bibtex` to force interpretation as BibTeX.

In BibTeX and BibLaTeX databases, pandoc parses LaTeX markup inside
fields such as `title`; in CSL YAML databases, pandoc Markdown; and in
CSL JSON databases, an [HTML-like
markup](https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/1.0/release-notes.html#rich-text-markup-within-fields):

`<i>...</i>`  
italics

`<b>...</b>`  
bold

`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">...</span>` or `<sc>...</sc>`  
small capitals

`<sub>...</sub>`  
subscript

`<sup>...</sup>`  
superscript

`<span class="nocase">...</span>`  
prevent a phrase from being capitalized as title case

As an alternative to specifying a bibliography file using
`--bibliography` or the YAML metadata field `bibliography`, you can
include the citation data directly in the `references` field of the
document’s YAML metadata. The field should contain an array of
YAML-encoded references, for example:

    ---
    references:
    - type: article-journal
      id: WatsonCrick1953
      author:
      - family: Watson
        given: J. D.
      - family: Crick
        given: F. H. C.
      issued:
        date-parts:
        - - 1953
          - 4
          - 25
      title: 'Molecular structure of nucleic acids: a structure for
        deoxyribose nucleic acid'
      title-short: Molecular structure of nucleic acids
      container-title: Nature
      volume: 171
      issue: 4356
      page: 737-738
      DOI: 10.1038/171737a0
      URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/171737a0
      language: en-GB
    ...

If both an external bibliography and inline (YAML metadata) references
are provided, both will be used. In case of conflicting `id`s, the
inline references will take precedence.

Note that pandoc can be used to produce such a YAML metadata section
from a BibTeX, BibLaTeX, or CSL JSON bibliography:

    pandoc chem.bib -s -f biblatex -t markdown
    pandoc chem.json -s -f csljson -t markdown

Indeed, pandoc can convert between any of these citation formats:

    pandoc chem.bib -s -f biblatex -t csljson
    pandoc chem.yaml -s -f markdown -t biblatex

Running pandoc on a bibliography file with the `--citeproc` option will
create a formatted bibliography in the format of your choice:

    pandoc chem.bib -s --citeproc -o chem.html
    pandoc chem.bib -s --citeproc -o chem.pdf

### Capitalization in titles

If you are using a bibtex or biblatex bibliography, then observe the
following rules:

- English titles should be in title case. Non-English titles should be
  in sentence case, and the `langid` field in biblatex should be set to
  the relevant language. (The following values are treated as English:
  `american`, `british`, `canadian`, `english`, `australian`,
  `newzealand`, `USenglish`, or `UKenglish`.)

- As is standard with bibtex/biblatex, proper names should be protected
  with curly braces so that they won’t be lowercased in styles that call
  for sentence case. For example:

      title = {My Dinner with {Andre}}

- In addition, words that should remain lowercase (or camelCase) should
  be protected:

      title = {Spin Wave Dispersion on the {nm} Scale}

  Though this is not necessary in bibtex/biblatex, it is necessary with
  citeproc, which stores titles internally in sentence case, and
  converts to title case in styles that require it. Here we protect “nm”
  so that it doesn’t get converted to “Nm” at this stage.

If you are using a CSL bibliography (either JSON or YAML), then observe
the following rules:

- All titles should be in sentence case.

- Use the `language` field for non-English titles to prevent their
  conversion to title case in styles that call for this. (Conversion
  happens only if `language` begins with `en` or is left empty.)

- Protect words that should not be converted to title case using this
  syntax:

      Spin wave dispersion on the <span class="nocase">nm</span> scale

### Conference Papers, Published vs. Unpublished

For a formally published conference paper, use the biblatex entry type
`inproceedings` (which will be mapped to CSL `paper-conference`).

For an unpublished manuscript, use the biblatex entry type `unpublished`
without an `eventtitle` field (this entry type will be mapped to CSL
`manuscript`).

For a talk, an unpublished conference paper, or a poster presentation,
use the biblatex entry type `unpublished` with an `eventtitle` field
(this entry type will be mapped to CSL `speech`). Use the biblatex
`type` field to indicate the type, e.g. “Paper”, or “Poster”. `venue`
and `eventdate` may be useful too, though `eventdate` will not be
rendered by most CSL styles. Note that `venue` is for the event’s venue,
unlike `location` which describes the publisher’s location; do not use
the latter for an unpublished conference paper.

## Specifying a citation style

Citations and references can be formatted using any style supported by
the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org), listed in the
[Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles). These files
are specified using the `--csl` option or the `csl` (or
`citation-style`) metadata field. By default, pandoc will use the
[Chicago Manual of Style](https://chicagomanualofstyle.org) author-date
format. (You can override this default by copying a CSL style of your
choice to `default.csl` in your user data directory.) The CSL project
provides further information on [finding and editing
styles](https://citationstyles.org/authors/).

The `--citation-abbreviations` option (or the `citation-abbreviations`
metadata field) may be used to specify a JSON file containing
abbreviations of journals that should be used in formatted
bibliographies when `form="short"` is specified. The format of the file
can be illustrated with an example:

    { "default": {
        "container-title": {
                "Lloyd's Law Reports": "Lloyd's Rep",
                "Estates Gazette": "EG",
                "Scots Law Times": "SLT"
        }
      }
    }

## Citations in note styles

Pandoc’s citation processing is designed to allow you to move between
author-date, numerical, and note styles without modifying the markdown
source. When you’re using a note style, avoid inserting footnotes
manually. Instead, insert citations just as you would in an author-date
style—for example,

    Blah blah [@foo, p. 33].

The footnote will be created automatically. Pandoc will take care of
removing the space and moving the note before or after the period,
depending on the setting of `notes-after-punctuation`, as described
below in [Other relevant metadata
fields](#other-relevant-metadata-fields).

In some cases you may need to put a citation inside a regular footnote.
Normal citations in footnotes (such as `[@foo, p. 33]`) will be rendered
in parentheses. In-text citations (such as `@foo [p. 33]`) will be
rendered without parentheses. (A comma will be added if appropriate.)
Thus:

    [^1]:  Some studies [@foo; @bar, p. 33] show that
    frubulicious zoosnaps are quantical.  For a survey
    of the literature, see @baz [chap. 1].

## Placement of the bibliography

If the style calls for a list of works cited, it will be placed in a div
with id `refs`, if one exists:

    ::: {#refs}
    :::

Otherwise, it will be placed at the end of the document. Generation of
the bibliography can be suppressed by setting
`suppress-bibliography: true` in the YAML metadata.

If you wish the bibliography to have a section heading, you can set
`reference-section-title` in the metadata, or put the heading at the
beginning of the div with id `refs` (if you are using it) or at the end
of your document:

    last paragraph...

    # References

The bibliography will be inserted after this heading. Note that the
`unnumbered` class will be added to this heading, so that the section
will not be numbered.

If you want to put the bibliography into a variable in your template,
one way to do that is to put the div with id `refs` into a metadata
field, e.g.

    ---
    refs: |
       ::: {#refs}
       :::
    ...

You can then put the variable `$refs$` into your template where you want
the bibliography to be placed.

## Including uncited items in the bibliography

If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing
them in the body text, you can define a dummy `nocite` metadata field
and put the citations there:

    ---
    nocite: |
      @item1, @item2
    ...

    @item3

In this example, the document will contain a citation for `item3` only,
but the bibliography will contain entries for `item1`, `item2`, and
`item3`.

It is possible to create a bibliography with all the citations, whether
or not they appear in the document, by using a wildcard:

    ---
    nocite: |
      @*
    ...

For LaTeX output, you can also use
[`natbib`](https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib) or
[`biblatex`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) to render the bibliography.
In order to do so, specify bibliography files as outlined above, and add
`--natbib` or `--biblatex` argument to pandoc invocation. Bear in mind
that bibliography files have to be in either BibTeX (for `--natbib`) or
BibLaTeX (for `--biblatex`) format.

## Other relevant metadata fields

A few other metadata fields affect bibliography formatting:

`link-citations`  
If true, citations will be hyperlinked to the corresponding bibliography
entries (for author-date and numerical styles only). Defaults to false.

`link-bibliography`  
If true, DOIs, PMCIDs, PMID, and URLs in bibliographies will be rendered
as hyperlinks. (If an entry contains a DOI, PMCID, PMID, or URL, but
none of these fields are rendered by the style, then the title, or in
the absence of a title the whole entry, will be hyperlinked.) Defaults
to true.

`lang`  
The `lang` field will affect how the style is localized, for example in
the translation of labels, the use of quotation marks, and the way items
are sorted. (For backwards compatibility, `locale` may be used instead
of `lang`, but this use is deprecated.)

A BCP 47 language tag is expected: for example, `en`, `de`, `en-US`,
`fr-CA`, `ug-Cyrl`. The unicode extension syntax (after `-u-`) may be
used to specify options for collation (sorting) more precisely. Here are
some examples:

- `zh-u-co-pinyin` – Chinese with the Pinyin collation.
- `es-u-co-trad` – Spanish with the traditional collation (with `Ch`
  sorting after `C`).
- `fr-u-kb` – French with “backwards” accent sorting (with `coté`
  sorting after `côte`).
- `en-US-u-kf-upper` – English with uppercase letters sorting before
  lower (default is lower before upper).

`notes-after-punctuation`  
If true (the default for note styles), pandoc will put footnote
references or superscripted numerical citations after following
punctuation. For example, if the source contains
`blah blah [@jones99].`, the result will look like `blah blah.[^1]`,
with the note moved after the period and the space collapsed. If false,
the space will still be collapsed, but the footnote will not be moved
after the punctuation. The option may also be used in numerical styles
that use superscripts for citation numbers (but for these styles the
default is not to move the citation).
