# Custom readers and writers

Pandoc can be extended with custom readers and writers written in
[Lua](https://www.lua.org). (Pandoc includes a Lua interpreter, so Lua
need not be installed separately.)

To use a custom reader or writer, simply specify the path to the Lua
script in place of the input or output format. For example:

    pandoc -t data/sample.lua
    pandoc -f my_custom_markup_language.lua -t latex -s

If the script is not found relative to the working directory, it will be
sought in the `custom` subdirectory of the user data directory (see
`--data-dir`).

A custom reader is a Lua script that defines one function, Reader, which
takes a string as input and returns a Pandoc AST. See the [Lua filters
documentation](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html) for documentation of
the functions that are available for creating pandoc AST elements. For
parsing, the [lpeg](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/) parsing
library is available by default. To see a sample custom reader:

    pandoc --print-default-data-file creole.lua

If you want your custom reader to have access to reader options
(e.g.Â the tab stop setting), you give your Reader function a second
`options` parameter.

A custom writer is a Lua script that defines a function that specifies
how to render each element in a Pandoc AST. See the
[djot-writer.lua](https://github.com/jgm/djot.lua/blob/main/djot-writer.lua)
for a full-featured example.

Note that custom writers have no default template. If you want to use
`--standalone` with a custom writer, you will need to specify a template
manually using `--template` or add a new default template with the name
`default.NAME_OF_CUSTOM_WRITER.lua` to the `templates` subdirectory of
your user data directory (see [Templates](#templates)).
