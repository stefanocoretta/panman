# Running pandoc as a web server

If you rename (or symlink) the pandoc executable to `pandoc-server`, or
if you call pandoc with `server` as the first argument, it will start up
a web server with a JSON API. This server exposes most of the conversion
functionality of pandoc. For full documentation, see the
[pandoc-server](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/doc/pandoc-server.md)
man page.

If you rename (or symlink) the pandoc executable to `pandoc-server.cgi`,
it will function as a CGI program exposing the same API as
`pandoc-server`.

`pandoc-server` is designed to be maximally secure; it uses Haskell’s
type system to provide strong guarantees that no I/O will be performed
on the server during pandoc conversions.
